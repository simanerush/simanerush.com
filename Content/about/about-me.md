👩🏻‍💻Hi! my name is Sima and I'm an experienced iOS Engineer. I'm proficient in Swift Programming language and passionate about creating new software!

💛I love working with and using:
• Swift
• SwiftUI, UIKit, Vision, CloudKit, Core Data, SpriteKit, SceneKit, ARKit
• Cocoapods, Swift Package Manager
• Concurrency

💻I enjoy working with open-source software, especially Swift, so I've made multiple contributions to the Swift Programming language code base.

🧩I've also fully built multiple iOS apps published to the App Store.
